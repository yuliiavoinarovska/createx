## Overview
This project is a website developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with a focus on following best practices and modern development techniques. It features a mobile-responsive design with a mobile menu, popup windows, sliders on various pages, thematic sorting tabs for showcasing projects, and a smooth scroll-to-top button. The website is fully responsive, adapting to screen sizes down to 320px width (without design layouts).

Currently, the following pages (with full functionality and interactivity) have been implemented:
1. <a href="https://yuliiavoinarovska.github.io/createx/" target="_blank">Main page</a>  
2. <a href="https://yuliiavoinarovska.github.io/createx/services.html" target="_blank">Services</a>
3. <a href="https://yuliiavoinarovska.github.io/createx/services-inner.html" target="_blank">Separate service page</a>
4. <a href="https://yuliiavoinarovska.github.io/createx/work.html" target="_blank">Work</a>

# Technologies and Methodologies:
## HTML
Modular markup approach was applied in developing HTML pages to create components and modules for their reusability and easy modification. Each component contains its own markup and styles, contributing to their independence from other elements on the page.

## CSS 
SASS preprocessor in SCSS syntax and BEM methodology were used to create structured and maintainable CSS and HTML code. CSS variables for site colors and main font, as well as mixins for commonly used style sets (breakpoints, flex, box shadow, etc.) were created. Classes with modifiers for styling headings, texts, form elements, and buttons were separated into individual files.

## Flexbox and CSS Grid
Both technologies were used to create a flexible and easily adaptable website. Media queries in combination with responsive units were used for optimal adaptation to all devices.


## JavaScript
All site functionality, including mobile menu, modal window, tabs, "Load more" button, accordion, smooth scroll â€” was implemented in native JS. Sliders were implemented using the Swiper Slider library.

## Gulp and Webpack
Gulp + Webpack build tools were used to automate development tasks such as compiling SCSS to CSS, using SVG sprites, bundling and optimizing JavaScript files, optimizing images, and more.

## HTML Pages Validation
All HTML pages passed validation with https://validator.w3.org/ for compliance with valid markup standards.
